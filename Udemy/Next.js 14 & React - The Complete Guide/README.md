# NextJS - The Complete Guide Course Resources

This repository contains course resources (code snapshots, attachments, slides) for my ["NextJS - The Complete Guide" course](https://acad.link/nextjs).

## How To Use

- [/attachments](/attachments/) contains lecture-specific attachments (which are directly attached to course lectures)
- [/code](/code/) contains multiple code snapshots for each course section - you can use those to compare your code to mine (to find + fix errors)
- [/other](/other/) contains other resources like course slides

I'm currently updating the course. This repository contains the resources for the new content (e.g., for the new "NextJS Essentials" section which uses NextJS' "App Router").

You find the resources for the "old course" (which covers the "Pages Router") [here](https://github.com/mschwarzmueller/nextjs-course-code).
