The objective of this exercise is to extend your Redux store to include support for reviews. And add it to `products/[id]/page`, `AverageRating` and `Reviews`.

Hint:

- Since your Redux store is global to the layout and contains the **reviews** you'll need to watch out for how to safely initialize that on route changes between detail pages.
