# Exercise 1 - Completing the React State version of the example

The goal of this exercise is finish the example by creating a `ReviewsContext` and `ReviewsProvider` that will send the reviews from the `products/page` component to the `AverageRating` and `Reviews` components.

It's worth noting that every time the customer navigates between routes that the `products/[id]/page` component will be re-created.

Hint:

- The output of the addReviewAction is the updated array of reviews

# Exercise 2 - Completing Redux version of the example

You'll need to remove the existing `CartContext` object and replace it with a Redux store.

**WARNING** You cannot safely use a Redux store that is defined as a global store.

You'll need to install `redux`, `react-redux` and `@reduxjs/toolkit`.

Here is an example counter slice:

```ts
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import type { PayloadAction } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

export interface CounterState {
  count: number;
}

const initialState: CounterState = {
  count: 0,
};

export const countSlice = createSlice({
  name: "count",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setCount: (state, action: PayloadAction<number>) => {
      state.count = action.payload;
    },
  },
});
```

Here is an example `createStore` function that creates a new Redux store.

```ts
export const createStore = () =>
  configureStore({
    reducer: {
      count: countSlice.reducer,
    },
  });
```

Here is a way to export the `setCount` action, as well as handy types and a selector for the `count`:

```ts
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";

export const { setCount } = countSlice.actions;

export type StoreType = ReturnType<typeof createStore>;
export type RootState = ReturnType<StoreType["getState"]>;
export type AppDispatch = StoreType["dispatch"];

export const useCount = () =>
  useSelector((state: RootState) => state.cart.cart);
```

To dispatch actions to the store use `useDispatch` to get a `dispatch` function. You use it like this:

```ts
dispatch(setCount(42));
```

# Exercise 3 - Completing the Zustand version of the example

You'll need to remove the existing `CartContext` object and replace it with a Zustand store. As well as create another Zustand store for reviews.

**WARNING** You cannot safely use a Zustand hooks declared globally.

You'll want to install the `zustand` library.

Zustand hooks are normally global, but you can also create a Zustand hook and pass it around in a context, like so:

```ts
"use client";
import { useState, createContext, useContext } from "react";
import { create } from "zustand";

const createStore = (count: number) =>
  create<{
    count: number;
    setCount: (cart: number) => void;
  }>((set) => ({
    count,
    setCount(count: number) {
      set({ count });
    },
  }));

const CountContext = createContext<ReturnType<typeof createStore> | null>(null);

export const useCount = () => {
  if (!CartContext)
    throw new Error("useCount must be used within a CountProvider");
  return useContext(CountContext)!;
};

const CountProvider = ({
  count,
  children,
}: {
  count: number;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) => {
  const [store] = useState(() => createStore(count));
  return (
    <CountContext.Provider value={store}>{children}</CountContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default CountProvider;
```

To get the Zustand hook in a `client` component you will do this:

```ts
const useCountHook = useCount();
```

From there you can call the hook like this:

```ts
const { count, setCount } = useCountHook();
```

You could shorten this to:

```ts
const { count, setCount } = useCount()();
```

You can also use selectors like so:

```ts
const count = useCount()((state) => state.count);
```

This will force a re-render only when the returned value from the selector changes.

# Exercise 4 - Completing the Jotai version of the example

You'll need to remove the existing `CartContext` object and replace it with a Jotai store. Then use atoms to model the cart and reviews.

**WARNING** You cannot safely use a Jotai atoms declared globally.

You'll need to add `jotai` to the project.

You create atoms using the `atom` function from Jotai, like so:

```ts
import { atom } from "jotai";
export const countAtom = atom<number>(0);
```

You can create a Jotai "store" for atoms using `createStore`. Here is an example provider that uses Jotai's `Provider` to pass the store around:

```ts
"use client";
import { useState } from "react";
import { createStore, Provider } from "jotai";

const StoreProvider = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => {
  const [store] = useState(() => createStore());
  return <Provider store={store}>{children}</Provider>;
};

export default StoreProvider;
```

Then in `client` components you will access the atoms using `useAtom` and `useAtomValue`. You'll get the current atom store using `useStore`. So to access the value of the count atom in the store you would use:

```ts
const countValue = useAtomValue(countAtom, {
  store: useStore(),
});
```

If you leave off the `useStore` then you'll be using the global atom value and that's not good since globals shouldn't be used with the App Router.

Hint:

- Since your Jotai store is global to the layout and contains the **reviews** you'll need to watch out for how to safely initialize that on route changes between detail pages.
