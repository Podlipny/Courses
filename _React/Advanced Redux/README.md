#### Application not working
Before trying any of the technique below, make sure your application is correctly coded.
1. Clone this repository's master branch
2. Without making any changes to it, run with `npm install` and `npm start`

This should solve 90% of errors. If not, see below: 

#### Correct admin priveleges (Mac only)
1. If you are using Mac, make sure that you installed Mac with [Brew](https://brew.sh/) so that proper admin priveleges are configured

#### Install Global packages
Depending on your OS, NPM may have a hard time running locally installed packages from the command line. To resolve this, manually install the dependencies under `devDependencies` with `npm install -g` or use the following script:

```bash
npm install -g babel-loader@6.2.8 babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread@6.19.0 babel-preset-es2015@6.18.0 babel-preset-react@6.23.0 babel-regenerator-runtime@6.5.0 nodemon@1.11.0 webpack@1.13.3 webpack-dev-server@1.16.2 webpack-hot-middleware@2.17.1 webpack-dev-middleware@1.10.1
```
