        <h1>About Coffee:</h1>
        <p>
        Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of 
        berries from the Coffea plant. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically 
        having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar,the Comoros, Mauritius, and RÃ©union 
        in the Indian Ocean. The plant was exported from Africa to countries around the world and 
        coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions 
        of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are the highly
        regarded arabica, and the less sophisticated but stronger and more hardy robusta. Once ripe, coffee
        berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as beans) are roasted 
        to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and brewed with 
        near-boiling water to produce coffee as a beverage.
